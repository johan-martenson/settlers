    TODO:

    add test for upgrade of non-occupied barracks!!

    player's list of buildings is correct
    gamemap mappoint, gamemap buildings

    percentage of upgrade progress is getting updated
    is possible to see if upgrades are possible
    promotion timers are running through upgrades
    it's not possible to deliver too much material to the barracks during upgrade
    barracks being upgraded can be attacked and won
    upgrades finish (and state goes back to normal)

    lack of space can hinder upgrades
    upgrade of regular building
    isUpgrading() in regular buildings
