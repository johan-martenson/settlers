    Fight:
     - One soldier waits in place for another soldier
     - Second soldier goes to the same point as the waiting soldier
     - They walk a little bit apart
     - Repeat until one of the soldiers dies:
         - One of them attacks
         - The other soldier:
            - Gets hit
            - Jumps back a bit
            - Stands on the side a bit

    Todo:
     - Test dying time
     - Test disappearing from map after dying time
     - Test skeleton is left
     - Test walking back to the point where the soldiers first met (instead of going further away)
