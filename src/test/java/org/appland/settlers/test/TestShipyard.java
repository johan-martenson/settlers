    *        - can only place shipyard close to water where ship can sail
    *        - test that shipwright doesn't pick point it cannot go to
    *   - the way the shipwright builds is to 1) pick a plank, 2) go to the ship, 3) hammer, 4) go back -- and iterate
    *   - what does a ship cost?
    *   - production of small boats - pause and resume, produce without connection to storage, place on flag, etc.
    *   - available construction around ship being built
    *   - switch between boats and ships during production
    *   - how far away from water can a ship be built?
    *   - rule for where shipyards can be placed???
    *   - test and handle case where there is no point to place the ship on (incl. wrong type of water)
    *   - can't build ship on stones, trees, houses, roads, flags
