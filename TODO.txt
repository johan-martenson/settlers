 Test
  - Plant tree at stone point

 1 Increase test coverage
  - Test to find house that needs a material while the house has more in the queue than it needs
  - Test getClosestStorage
  - Test getMaterialsToBuildHouse
  - Test getQueue
  - Test looking for a building that needs a material and has nothing in its queue
  - Test that too much material can't be delivered to a house under construction
